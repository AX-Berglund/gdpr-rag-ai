# GDPR RAG Helper

**A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering GDPR-related questions with accuracy and transparency.**

## Overview

The GDPR RAG Helper is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify and demystify the complexities of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to retrieve relevant sections of the GDPR text and generate clear, concise answers to user queries.

### Key Features
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve the most relevant GDPR articles and clauses based on natural language queries.
- **Context-Aware Q&A:** Generate accurate responses with references to the regulation.
- **Summarization:** Simplify complex GDPR sections into concise summaries.
- **Transparency:** Provides citations to the original text for every response.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The GDPR text is parsed and segmented into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., articles, paragraphs).
   
2. **Embedding Generation:**
   - Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`.

3. **Vector Database:**
   - A vector store (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) is used to store embeddings for efficient retrieval.

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:**
   - User queries are processed to:
     1. Retrieve relevant GDPR sections.
     2. Combine the retrieved text with the query and generate an answer using OpenAI GPT.

5. **User Interface:**
   - A user-friendly interface allows users to input queries and view detailed responses with source citations.
